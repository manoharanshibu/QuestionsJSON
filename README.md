### Set up

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Task

To test your programming skill, we'd like you to have a go at a small task.

We have provided you with four JSON files (in /data). These files provide you with a table of contents (sections.json), questions (/[\d]+(,[\d]+)+/.json), and a list of view states (states.json). Your task is to use this data to produce a content view page.

You should start with loading data from all four files. The view should display sections and questions altogether and the content tree hierarchy should be easy to read. All questions should remain collapsed unless their tocId is on expanded list.

The starting state should leave all questions collapsed and the UI should include a button allowing to cycle through the view states list.


Some things to note:
* Your solution should work in any modern browser, but you don't need to worry about making it fully cross browser or supporting older browsers.
* The root of the sections tree has id -1.
* Simplicity is key.
* Remember to make use of the app states provided.
* There's no need to make requests to load data, keep it static.
* You can use this file to list any improvements you didn't have time to implement.
